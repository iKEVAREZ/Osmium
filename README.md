# Osmium

Osmium is an abstraction layer for Bukkit and Sponge. This project aims to provide the easiest most concise way to create Minecraft plugins period. In addition to being able to target multiple different platforms, Osmium has many unique features which drastically reduce the amount of code necessary to complete many different tasks.

Although it will take a very long time to implement enough features to have a complete Minecraft API, Osmium should be in a usable state fairly soon. Plugins requiring any part of a specific platform which Osmium has not implemented yet can simply write platform specific code just as they would without Osmium while at the same time still using what we do have implemented.

## Features

 * Platform independent
 * Automatic registration of commands
 * More concise command API
 * Automatic registration of listeners
 * More concise listener API
 * Service API which allows custom services
 * And much more...
